# rootdir

function [status,msg,msgID,mk_path_fin]=rootdir(root,dir_lvl,dir_names)

This function creates directories relative to specified root directory

Inputs:
 - root: root directory where the directories are to be created 
 - dir_lvl: level of directory, relative to root directory (row vector)
 - dir_names: name of each correspoding directory (row vector)

Outputs:
 - for all other options (k-nearest points)
     1. status -> Folder creation status indicating whether the attempt to
          create the folder is successful, returned as 0 or 1. 
          If the attempt to create the folder is successful or the folder 
          already exists,then the value of status is 1. Otherwise, the
          value is 0.
     2. msg -> Error message, returned as a character vector. If an error
          or warning occurs, msg contains the message text of the error or
          warning. Otherwise, msg is empty, ''.
	  3. msgID -> Error message identifier, returned as a character vector.
          If an error or warning occurs, msgID contains the message identifier
          of the error or warning. Otherwise, msgID is empty, ''.
	  4. mk_path_fin -> the yielded full file paths.

 to do list:
 - automatic report generation
 - improve processing speed via mexing or not ->pre-allocate all cells and matrixes (too large paths of directory cannot be created because
 there is a limit and actually there is no point of such paths but I want to try to make it faster)
